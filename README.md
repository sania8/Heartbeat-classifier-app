  heart- beat sound classification app
  The app is a deep learning model (yolov8) based app which takes in audio file (.wav format ) and returns the predicted output as normal heart beat sound or abnormal heart beat sound
  the following is the link to the app : https://heartsoundclassification.streamlit.app/ 
  The model's accuracy metrics is as follows:
    Top-1 Accuracy: Approximately 94.6%
    Top-5 Accuracy: 100% (Flawless)
    Fitness Metric: Approximately 97.3%
  Dataset used for this project is : PhysioNet Heart Sound Dataset
